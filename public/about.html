<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Prerna Priya and I'm 18 years old. I am from Bokaro, Jharkhand. I have done my schooling from St. Xavier's School, Bokaro.
  I have completed my 12th with Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Computer Science and a mandatory language subject English from
  ISC Board. I had scored 93% in ICSE 10th Board Examination and have scored 90.75% in my ISC 12th Board Examination.
  I was the member of the Science Club of my school. My group project had won the 3rd prize in my school's Science Exhibition.
  I have participated in several olympiads and spell bee competitions during my middle school and have gone upto state level. I have shown active
participation in various cultural programs throughout my school life. I was also part of my school's School Band.

<p>I have been learning Java since Std. 8. Currently I'm learning Web Development and thus I'm working on my skills on HTML.
    I am a language enthusiast, I love to learn and explore new languages. I have a particular affinity towards Asian languages. 
  I am an upper intermediate in Korean language and a beginner in Japanese. My hobbies include singing, learning, 
   listening to music, astrology, spirituality, science and technology. I used to play flute in my School Band. I wish to 
   learn guitar in the future as well. I listen to a wide range of genres of music. Coding is fun for me as well.
</p>

<p> I have an easy-going friendly personality.
 I am an open-minded individual who has a positive outlook towards life. I strive to make myself better everyday. 
  I am dedicated towards the work I love. I have great researching skills. I have a keen eye for detail. I am often the person
   in a group project who gathers all the main content for the project and also looks out for even the finest details at the end of it. 
   I am usually the one who stays behind the curtain and does all the work. I work best in teams and consider everybody's ideas 
   in the group. A quote by Alexander Pope that very well describes me is, “No one should be ashamed to admit he is wrong, which is but saying, 
   in other words, that he is wiser today than he was yesterday.”
